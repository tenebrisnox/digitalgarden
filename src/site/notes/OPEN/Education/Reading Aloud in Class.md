Alex Quigley argues against "popcorn" or RRR (round-robin reading). https://www.theconfidentteacher.com/2022/02/who-should-read-aloud-in-class/

Professor Diane Lapp, from San Diego State University suggests (in  If You Want Students to Read Widely and Well - Eliminate Round-Robin Reading (2012)):

1.  **Repeated reading**, which involves repeating a reading modelled ﬁrst by the teacher or another proﬁcient reader.
2.  **Choral reading**, which means reading together with others who are proﬁcient readers.
3.  **Echo reading**, or the student echoing or repeating what the proﬁcient reader has just read.
4.  **Readers’ Theatre** involves a dramatic reading of a text or script by the students.
5.  **Neurological impress**, which involves the student and teacher reading together while tracking words.
