The KS3 curriculum should enable students to develop a basic understanding of elements like language change and periods in the history of English Literature.

### -isms

Students should broadly be aware of Romanticism, Gothic and Modernism. Feminism?

### Children as Writers

From the very start, students seen as creative writers.
1st term = write a novel!

### Critical Approaches
Looking at texts through different points of view (not just self): eg. eco, post-colonial, feminist.

### Questions BEFORE Answers

Encouraging children to ask questions rather than (slavishly) answer questions. Building this habit early in school.

### Planning Questions 
Megan Mansworth in [[OPEN/Education/Teach to the Top\|Teach to the Top]] suggests that examples of potential deep or high-level questions should be written into the curriculum plan.
