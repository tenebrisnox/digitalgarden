Teach to the Top is the idea that teaching should ensure that the learning is genuinely challenging (and that all students are supported in reaching the top)

### Megan Mansworth's *Teach to the Top*


#### Chapter 2: Embedding Challenge Across the Curriculum: ideology and mindset

Mansworth focuses on curriculum design and planning: which concepts, ideas and knowledge are prioritised. She emphasises that the content that is chosen is ideological (also the purpose of the subject). She advises that a collective mindset of challenge is developed (she draws on Hattie who ranked collective efficacy as the top factor that influences student achievement)
