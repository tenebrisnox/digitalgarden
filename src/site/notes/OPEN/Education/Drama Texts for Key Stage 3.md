Drama texts for younger students. One issue is that many are adaptations of novels.

- Ernies Incredible Illuccinations by Alan Ayckbourn - https://archivingayckbourn.home.blog/2020/11/11/ernies-incredible-illucinations/amp/

- Blood Brothers (if An Inspector Calls is used at KS4)

- DNA by Denis Kelley (but there are issues of swearing and aubject matter)
