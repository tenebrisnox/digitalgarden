Why do we teach English?

https://www.theconfidentteacher.com/2021/11/arguing-about-english/

Interesting article by Alex Quigley in which he simply re-presents the Cox Report's (1988) five viewpoints about English:

- personal growth (relationship between language and learning in individual child and the role that literature has in developing imaginative and aesthetic lives);
- cross-curricular (servicing the language requirements of children so they can access the curriculum in other subjects);
- adult needs (preparing children for literacy requirements of adult life in the workplace);
- cultural heritage (appreciation of literature);
- cultural analysis (critical understanding of the world we live in and the processes by which media and print carry values).
