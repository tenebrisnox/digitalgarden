- Quigley argues that being brought up in a "word-poor" home with a restricted vocabulary can have profound implications on children's lives (employment, pay, wellbeing, health). Vocabulary instruction needs to be explicit and by explicitly teaching 300-500 words a year an annual growth of 3000 to 4000 words can be fostered. Challenges of new academic curriculum demands complex academic vocabulary. Supporting children to read more is vital but needs to be structured to teach reading - not just for pleasure.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Receptive vocabulary: "the words we hear and read".
  Expressive vocabulary: "the words we say and write".
  
  Talk is "a well established solution for developing children's vocabulary".
  
  Around 2000 words make up 80% of our spoken language.

  “If we simply encourage talk in the classroom, without a structured approach to using academic language in our talk, it will not develop our children’s language.”
  
  "help our students emblazon their speech with the academic vocabulary that sets them apart for success beyond the school gates"
  
  “Rich, structured talk is a solution to closing the vocabulary gap in our classroom. If this is twinned with high quality reading instruction, then we are well on the way to help children thrive with any curriculum.”
  
  Quigley argues that exposure to vocabulary - through talk and reading - is not enough and requires explicit vocabulary instruction.
  
  **We need to cultivate WORD CONSCIOUSNESS in every child.** (Noticing words and are interested and curious about them).
  
  We want children leaving school with a vocabulary of 50k words!
