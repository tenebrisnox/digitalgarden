DfE guidance from 2005 seems to be still useful in managing actions in improving reading on a departmental level:

[[Improving Reading - DfE (2005).pdf]]

Particularly useful:

- Generic Observation Checklist (page 26)

- Suggested Prompts for Pupil Interviews on a reading unit (page 27)

- Building a Year 7 reading profile (pages 29-32)

- KS4 Reading Profile (page 33)

- Provides examples of reading action plans.
