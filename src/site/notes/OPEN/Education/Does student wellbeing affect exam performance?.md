Apparently not, according to Education Datalab: https://ffteducationdatalab.org.uk/2022/04/is-there-is-a-link-between-year-11-pupils-wellbeing-and-their-gcse-grades/

>Differences in GCSE grades are – on the whole – pretty small. Having low levels of wellbeing in Year 11 is associated with only a modest decrease in the probability of achieving a grade 4 in mathematics (75%, compared to 78% for their peers with “average” levels of wellbeing).

>On the other hand, there is no evidence that those Year 11s who feel particularly joyful do any better on their GCSEs than other groups (they in fact have a slightly lower chance of achieving a grade 4 in mathematics than the “average” wellbeing group).
