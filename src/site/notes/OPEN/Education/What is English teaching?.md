Harold Rosen:

> the teacher of English, whose syllabus – it is often said – is quite simply life  itself


Literature is the central humanising experience of the curriculum and critical discrimination a morally educative activity.

### Aspects of English
- Basic skills.
- Literature.
- Creativity (and personal growth through creativity).
- Growth through linguistic competence.
- Engagement with personal and social issues.
  
### Additionally
  
  Creative teaching involves the delivery of material in a manner which encourages the student to be motivated/engaged and transfer his or her knowledge and apply the knowledge to solve problems 
  
  Experiment and innovation seen quite narrowly as means in which to better prepare children for examination.
  
  Current English (certainly at secondary) is aping classics: knowledge about texts plus regurgitation of views about themes, characters, formal elements. Personal, emotional responses downgraded.
  
  Differences between the cognitive and the affective subjects.
  
  Are the four main activities within English: literature, creativity, discrimination, and classroom talk?
  
  English is an affective education.
  
  Literature or personal experience as stimulus for writing? (Perhaps influence of Jungian personality development after WW2; English contributing to the process of individuation?)
  
  A rich reading classroom.
