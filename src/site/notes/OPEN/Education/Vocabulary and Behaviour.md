IoE research paper compared connections between misbehaviour at 5 and subsequent performance in a multiple-choice vocabulary test at age 15; also compared results between two different generations 30 years apart.

**Key Findings seemed to be that children have a more limited vocabulary than 1970s and that there is a link between (early) behavioural issues and later more limited vocabulary knowledge.**


Data from the 1970 British Cohort Study (17000 people) and the Millennium Cohort Study (19000).

Two main outcomes:
- Children with reported behavioural problems at age 5 performed more poorly on a vocabulary test as teenagers in both cohorts.
- Teenagers in the MCS performed more poorly on the vocabulary test in comparison to the 1970s cohort.

Professor Alice Sullivan (UCL, Insitute of Education):

>“Using longitudinal data, following these children over time, allowed us to demonstrate that these emotional and behavioural problems have an ongoing impact on learning throughout the school years.

>“This won’t surprise teachers because, when you look at the kinds of factors that feed into the scales of measuring childhood emotional and behavioural problems – irritable, disobedient, restless – these kinds of behaviours make learning more difficult.”

>“It could be a decline in reading books compared to spending time on other activities, such as online activities, could have led to a decline in vocabulary. What we have is just one piece of evidence but it suggests a need for further investigation.”

Alex Quigley (EEF):

>“It is hard to untangle the causes and correlations when it comes to a child’s vocabulary, language development and their behaviours in school,” he says. “Is their behaviour and inability to self-regulate hampering their ability to learn in the classroom or is their limited vocabulary causing children to act out and misbehave?""
